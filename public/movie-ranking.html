<h1>The Best Movies According To Kane</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shooter</h3>

<p>
 I love action movies but also love movies with a great story line with great depth to them. 
 This was a favorite of mine as a young adult and has been ever since.

<h3>Angel Has Fallen</h3>

<p>
    The best in the trilogy in my opinion. 
    I am a sucker for Gerard Butler movies because he is such a phenomenal actor but this was definitely the best of the 3. 
    Big action scenes, double crossing and supplemental actors helping to save the day!
</p>

<h3>Remember The Titans</h3>

<p>
    What a phenomenal piece of history to remember! 
    Came out when I was a kid and was a beautifully made movie! 
    Awesome actors, great story line, and great morals of the movie!
