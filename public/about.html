<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am getting back into my nerdy side and learning a lot about Web and App Development!
  I have always loved technology and all that it entails,
  but got caught up in life and moved away from it.
  But I am back!</p>

<p>I currently work for a car dealership,
  but if Angela's training goes well, 
  that could all change in a hurry!
  I have a growing family and my full time job occupying my time,
  but I am making time to learn!
